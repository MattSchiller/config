# config
A lightweight way to setup my toolkit across different machines

## Setting up a new machine (Mac)

### Install zsh
[zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)

### Setup Dotfiles, oh-my-zsh, Ag, etc...
    ./setup

### Homebrew
This should be setup automatically by ./setup, but you may want to run

    brew doctor

to check out that its not missing anything vital (like XQuartz)
