## config
A lightweight way to setup my toolkit across different machines

Note: This repo should be setup in ~/repos

### Setting up a new machine
Mac:
```
./setup.mac
```
Linux:
```
./setup.linux
```

### Homebrew
This should be setup automatically by ./setup, but you may want to run

    brew doctor

to check out that its not missing anything vital (like XQuartz)
